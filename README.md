# What The Fox
A Minecraft mod that fixes [MC-263591](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263591) and [MC-147230](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-147230) to try and stop them from hurting foxes unintentionally.

## What The Mod Does

## Hurting Foxes Unintentionally?
If a fox ever enters a body of water while diving, [MC-263591](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263591) will cause them to be unable to move and be underwater, which eventually causes them to drown :(. However this mod prevents that from happening!

## Known Issues
Currently, it's still a little buggy, [MC-147230](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-147230) can still trigger briefly while in the water but it's miles ahead of what vanilla is.
