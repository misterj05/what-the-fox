# What The Fox
A Fabric mod that adds a failsafe to prevent [MC-263591](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263591) from hurting foxes unintentionally.
**This does not outright fix the bug, it just adds a failsafe incase the bug ever gets triggered.**

## What The Mod Does

## Hurting Foxes Unintentionally?
If a fox ever enters a body of water while diving, [MC-263591](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263591) will cause them to be unable to move and be underwater, which eventually causes them to drown :(. However this mod prevents that from happening!

## Known Issues
Currently if the mod runs to get the fox unstuck while the fox is in water it **WILL** become bugged and only swim in one direction, better than them drowning imo but I'm working on figuring this out as well.
